External-validation reply update: 2026-08-28 (Asia/Shanghai). The ledger records
conceptual validation separately from an actual code, secured-graph, or Shadow
run so that a positive reply cannot silently close a stronger external gate.

## Method and classification rule

The connected Gmail account was searched with `in:anywhere`, including Spam
and Trash, for RLSOK, ROS/robot, execution/authorization, configuration,
controller, runtime/provenance, DDS, CANopen, RMF, MAVROS, Nav2, teleoperation,
and fault terms. The search covered all mail through the audit time, including
late replies received through 2026-08-28. Full threads were read; the
ledger does not infer a claim from a subject or snippet.

Feedback determines what to inspect, not what to believe. Status is assigned
from reproducible RLSOK code, tests, and architecture, not the sender's role,
tone, or authority.

Status totals (39 meaningful replies):

| E04 | Denis Stogl / ros2_control — 2026-08-16 — Gmail `1a009f585690b6e6`; follow-ups through 2026-08-27 | “Release authority before dispatch” was initially not understandable. Later guidance noted that unchanged controller/action APIs may hide execution-relevant lifecycle, resource, timing, and failure changes; the latest reply says the clarified boundary is understandable, cleanly separated from ros2_control, viable in principle, and resembles approaches seen previously. | Comprehension evidence, a generic lower-level provenance requirement, and conceptual boundary confirmation; not code review or a support claim. | Public copy explains the boundary. The selected-provenance contract binds lower-level execution semantics or an integration-qualified compatibility envelope. **CODE/DOC-FIXED; REFERENCE-CONTRACT; EXTERNAL VALIDATION OPEN**. | Retest comprehension independently. Keep runtime/API classification adapter-owned; do not add a ros2_control integration or claim endorsement, official support, or implementation validation. Contributor opt-in recorded in the attribution source. High comprehension-validation value. |

URSim is the closest no-hardware stand-in. | Directly reproducible against the official driver/URSim. | UR5e integration binds the scaled controller and official-driver tests cover mock/reference behavior. No Core assumption depends on a zero-target skip. **IMPLEMENTED**. | Preserve wording that Shadow omits dispatch rather than sending a zero goal. Public attribution uses Rune's exact approved display name, organization, URL and contribution wording, with an explicit no-endorsement boundary for both Rune and Universal Robots.

| E08 | Husarion Support — 2026-08-17 — Gmail `1a00fce17d82288a`; follow-up context 2026-08-26 | The initial Webots/Shadow ask was not understandable; Husarion officially supports Gazebo, not its old Webots path. Later Webots/ros2_control guidance raised lower-level runtime/API compatibility only as a speculative generic concern. | Reproducible comprehension and support-matrix correction; the later point is generic provenance guidance, not Webots validation. | Official Gazebo reference and DDS readiness regression remain complete. The generic runtime compatibility reference covers the speculative concern without changing the support matrix. **CODE/DOC-FIXED; EXTERNAL VALIDATION OPEN** for first-time comprehension. | Keep Webots out of the official Husarion claim and use the human protocol. No extra robot integration and no validation claim from speculative guidance. High comprehension value. |

OPEN_LOOP uses prior command state rather than measured motion. | Concrete future-adapter authorization invariants, version-specific to the actual Nav2 action/parameter definitions; not a review of RLSOK implementation. | Runtime v1.4.5 dispatches only strict `FollowJointTrajectory` proposals and has no Nav2 `FollowPath` adapter, so there is no current selector bypass. The earlier limits-only reference was incomplete and is now narrowed to a Jazzy-specific selected semantics/source/topology/selector contract. **REFERENCE-CONTRACT CORRECTED; NAV2 INTEGRATION NOT IMPLEMENTED**. | Do not add speculative Nav2 execution support.

## Feedback closure audit

### BlueROV2 / Subcat

**A — representability:** yes, with an adapter. v2 can bind robot/device,
logical command endpoint, controller implementation/version, mappings,
`limitsDigest`, and provenance. `solver_id` may be an explicit software source;
the generated solver may be a `generated` source (input digest plus generator)
or content digest. RC/servo mapping, MAVROS namespace, serial configuration,
and selected limits must be projected into a stable adapter-owned content or
semantic digest; incidental observations must not be copied into identity.

**B — synchronous Cloud at the hardware boundary:** the original
`CloudConnectedDispatchBoundary` still performs Cloud work and must not be put
inside a hard write callback. `packages/edge-authorization/snapshot.ts` now
provides the alternative: an Ed25519 issuer/refresh path outside the callback
and bounded local verification immediately before one dispatch.

**C — ownership:** the snapshot binds release content, action, configuration,
device, controller, issue/expiry time and revocation epoch. Unknown key,
invalid signature, rollback epoch, stale/future time or changed binding fails
closed with zero dispatch. The boundary is single-use, has no Cloud dependency,
retry, stop or zero fallback, and returns exact snapshot/version/digest fields
for Evidence. BlueROV/MAVROS identity selection remains adapter-owned; no
BlueROV driver was added.

### DDS command-path trust

Core's normalized contract is sufficient if an authenticated adapter supplies:

- source `kind`: `dds-security-monitor` (vendor/version recorded);
- required capability: `dds.command_path.trusted` for the configured logical
  actuator path;
- continuity token: a stable digest of the authenticated expected actuator
  peer/endpoint/session set, not a raw unauthenticated GUID;
- fresh `observedAt`.

An unrelated rejected participant must not remove the scoped capability. Loss
of the expected actuator endpoint, stale trust, failed authentication, or an
untrusted command-critical peer removes it (or makes attestation unavailable),
which Core already fails closed. The runnable Fast DDS Security fixture proves
the scoped normalization and refuses raw GUID/name trust. It preserves
`unknown` for missing or insufficient proof and `untrusted` for an explicit
command-path rejection; both emit no trusted capability. Participant
authentication without enforced governance and validated path permissions also
remains `unknown`, not trusted. A real secured Fast DDS graph and CycloneDDS
extraction remain external tests; RLSOK does not authenticate DDS traffic or
claim portable RMW rejection reasons. The follow-up conceptually validates the
path-scoped design, not the code or a secured-graph run.

### Selected interface semantics and physical execution identity

Version 2 already hashes the selected semantic contract and selected provenance
for one approval. The generic reference makes the selection boundary explicit:
base robot description, actuator/sensor configuration, controller interfaces,
command semantics, and execution-relevant runtime/software/configuration facts
may be selected. A consumed IMU sign/timing contract is therefore an
interface-scoped provenance source; changing it invalidates that approval even
when topic, type, controller/action interface, and URDF are unchanged. An
approval that does not consume the IMU omits that source, so the same unrelated
change does not globally invalidate it.

The same rule applies below unchanged ros2_control and hardware_interface APIs.
Lifecycle, resource, timing, or failure-behavior changes invalidate approval
unless the integration explicitly qualifies and emits a stable compatibility
envelope. Simulator worlds, visuals, incidental plugins, and unrelated
environment noise are excluded by default. The AD-R1M and Unity replies support
this generic boundary only; neither creates a vendor integration or support
claim. The Webots/ros2_control point remains speculative guidance, not external
validation.

### Queued command and selected observed-state epoch

The audit found no missing Core/schema epoch. A Permit already binds the exact
action hash, release, device/target, controller and selected configuration; it
is short-lived and consumed before execute-time checks. Immediately before
dispatch, Core refreshes the release record, configuration and any required
`RuntimeAttestation`. An adapter that selects execution-relevant state uses the
existing continuity token as its bounded state epoch and exposes a required
capability. Changed continuity, missing/stale observation, or unknown/not-ready
capability records a specific zero-dispatch Evidence reason. A newer timestamp
or an unselected capability change remains eligible, so unrelated sensor noise
does not become global invalidation.

The ROS 2 reference did contain a separate boundary defect: revocation tried to
cancel a previously accepted goal. That cancel IPC and call path were removed.
Revocation now prevents only a new dispatch. Controller-accepted execution,
controlled stop, safety stop, hold, zero command, and retries remain outside
RLSOK.

### Fault and degradation capability

Core already implements the requested semantics: deterministic
`requiredCapabilities`, a fresh adapter-owned available capability set,
source/version/continuity stability, execute-time refresh, and zero dispatch on
missing/stale/changed attestation. The degradation reference now maps an
external classifier report to capabilities and proves that cleared fault with
capability still absent remains blocked, while restored capability with fresh
continuity can pass. The fault manager continues to own evidence and
classification; RLSOK does not clear, diagnose, or classify faults.

### GOLEM / CorrellLab reference and external acceptance test

1. Use a fork/branch of the public H12 controller and a non-moving Shadow
   environment; do not send H12 goals.
2. The exact input is schema v1 `sourceIdentity`, `observedAt`,
   `continuityToken`, `monitorVersion`, and external boolean
   `upperBodyMotionReady`. The reference translates only that verdict into
   `upper_body.motion_ready`.
3. The approved ExecSpec requires `upper_body.motion_ready`.
4. Fresh, continuous, ready state produces an eligible Shadow observation and
   Evidence with `hardwareSignalSent: false`.
5. False, missing, stale, unknown/malformed input, monitor replacement, or
   continuity change removes eligibility and records the exact fail-closed
   reason, still with zero command.
6. `upper_body.motion_ready` means only that the selected external monitor says
   the capability needed before a new command is available. It is not an RLSOK
   inference of collision/contact/caught state or motor safety.
7. CorrellLab judgment is still required on the report owner boundary, the
   capability name, which transitions rotate continuity, and the concrete
   ready/not-ready/missing/stale/replacement fixtures. RLSOK does not implement
   GOLEM or send a cancellation/safety stop for an executing H12 trajectory.

### BXI dependency provenance

Current v2 provenance can represent policy artifact identity, controller/config
identity, and explicit runtime dependencies. PyTorch, NumPy, a custom inference
library, or an allowlisted lock/manifest can be named explicitly using software
identity/version or a content digest. Automatic closure over the entire Python
environment would create noisy invalidation and is intentionally not required.
No new Core field is justified. The allowlist-driven collector now emits the
explicit inference-runtime manifest chosen by the integrator, rejects missing
or version-mismatched declared dependencies, ignores unrelated packages, and
never performs `pip freeze` or whole-environment hashing.

### Open-RMF boundary

The two replies establish that task award/adapter acceptance is the authority
inside RMF and that RMF does not expose a distinct final robot-command
release-authorization semantic. RLSOK's existing placement below fleet/task
planning therefore matches the evidence. This is **IMPLEMENTED/VALIDATED**, not
an Open-RMF feature backlog.

### No-action follow-ups

Jacob / ros_gz supplied no reproducible new invariant, so it creates no backlog
or new ledger row. BlueROV2/Subcat remains fully represented by E32 and the
existing signed-edge-authorization section; no duplicate work was added.

## Reviewed replies excluded from status counts

The following exact replies were read but did not make a concrete technical or
comprehension claim: topic-based ros2_control author unavailable (`1a0173132f3361ea`),
OpenArm redirect to Discussions (`1a02308b943d2aaf`), Kinova support redirect
(`1a01f92e52082d57`), Cyberbotics no-bandwidth reply (`19ffbb0dba98ee67`), and
automated delivery/marketing/out-of-office responses. They do not create a
feature backlog. The Nav2 docking, Fourier, and Gradisen replies remain in the
ledger because they change external-validation priority or product stage fit.

## Remaining real-world gates

There is no unexplained `PARTIAL` or unrepresented generic defect in the 37-row
ledger. Remaining gates are explicit and external:

- run the DDS reference against a secured Fast DDS graph and add a CycloneDDS
  extractor only when authenticated signals are actually available;
- have ros2_medkit, GOLEM, Clearpath, CANopen, Nav2, Elite, CRANE-X7 and device
  owners exercise the provided contracts/fixtures before any support claim;
- perform uncoached Class A first-time comprehension and Class B regression
  validation against the live public site and Zero-to-Shadow path;
- recontact Quan, General Axis, Nav2 docking and Fourier only when they have a
  concrete release/dispatch environment. Their deferral does not justify a new
  integration.

These are external validation gates, not permission to broaden Core or add a
robot integration.
